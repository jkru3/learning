### 12 factor app
- **I. Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
    - git
    - multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of the 12 factor app
- **II. Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
    - `requirements.txt`
    - can't assume dependencies will exist on an app you are working on
    - virtual environment (venv)
        - this does NOT account for tools dependent on system outside of lang (e.g. curl)
        - docker can use tools outside of Python's capabilities
- **III. Config**: Store config in the environment
    - you might store hosts to get a backing service as ENV
    - dev, test, prod
- **IV. Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
    - no matter what backing service we use, we should be able to point to any instance and it should just work
- **V. Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
    - dev phase first
- **VI. Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
    - "sticky sessions" -- load balancers that redirect users to a particular server
        - they are a VIOLATION of 12 factor
    - all session info must be stored as backing service in a db
- **VII. Port binding**: Export services via port binding
    - completely self contained
- **VIII. Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
    - load balancer helps with this
    - processes are a first class citizen, so we want to scale out horizontally, not vertically
- **IX. Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
    - provision additional instances at a moments notice (seconds)
    - apps should shut down gracefully when a SIGTERM (polite process kill) is received
- **X. Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
    - use same tech in everything if possible
- **XI. Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
    - do not concern app with storage and routing, just stream it
- **XII. Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes 
    - should be automated, scalable, and reproducable. exact same as non-admin processes
