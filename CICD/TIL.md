- CI: automated building and testing of code when changes are pushed
    - Detects conflicts/bugs
    - maintains a single source of truth
    - linting!
- CD (delivery): Every code change that passes all tests is automatically prepared for release, though often with manual approval
    - environment management (dev, staging, production)
    - deployment strategies
        - blue/green: two versions, green one is active, blue one is on standby incase something happens
        - canary: deployed to subset of users. if issues detected, roll out to more
        - rolling: rolled out to a few servers at a time
    - Feature toggles
        - features deployed but toggled by configuration so they can be quickly disabled if needed
    - tree-trunk-based development
        - short-lived feature branches and merged into main branch (the trunk) daily. more manageable changes
- CD (deploy): if a business is confident in delivery's reliability, they may deploy automatically to production if it passes CI

### paradigms:
- GitOps: uses Git as single source of truth
    - simple audit trail
    - works well with Kubernetes and cloud-native arch
    - requires strong git practices
    - bottlenecks with large monorepos. git operations slower with larger repos
- Progressive Delivery: extends CD with incremental releases (feature flags, canary deployments, A/B testing)
    - tech debt from outdated feature flags
    - more complex testing
    - can test in prod with real users (A/B)
    - supports more experimentation
- Value Stream Delivery: optimize workflow for customer value 
    - map out entire delivery process, always maximizing customer value
- DevSecOps: security integrated in development lifecycle rather than separate
    - requires security expertise across teams
    - can slow down pipelines if not optimized
    - can be resource intensive
- Waterfall development: traditional handoffs

- popular tools
    - Jenkins
        - open-source
        - self-hosted
            - you install it on your own servers and self manage
        - automation server
            - builds code automatically and triggers actions
        - best for large orgs needing complete control over CI/CD
        - highly customizable
        - FREE
        - steep learning curve
    - GitHub Actions
        - native GItHub CI/CD and tightly integrated with it
        - YAML configuration
            - YAML does everything JSON does (and more)
        - free for public, paid for private
        - best for open-source projects and SMALL PROJECTS
    - GitLab CI
        - GitLab has more complete DevOps platform that GitHub
        - container based workflows
        - STARTUPS
    - CircleCI
        - YAML based config. they all use YAML
        - supports macOS and Linux well
        - best for cloud native apps and containerized workflows
        - STRONG CONTAINER SUPPORT
    - Travis CI
        - simple
- Docker and containerization's role
    - package applications with dependencies
    - isolate apps from each other
    - ensure consistent build environments
    - no more "it works on my machine"
- role of Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
    - using code to handle infrastructure rather than manual configuration
    - might create aws servers with code
- deploying code with IaC
