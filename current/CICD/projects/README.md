Small Project Idea: Set Up a Basic CI/CD Pipeline
This hands-on project will demonstrate your practical knowledge:

Create a simple application (a basic Node.js web app or Python Flask app)
Set up a GitHub repository for it
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file that:

Runs whenever code is pushed
Builds your application
Runs automated tests
Deploys to a free hosting service (like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel)

This project would let you discuss real implementation details in your interview while demonstrating practical experience.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these concepts or provide more specific guidance for the sample project?
