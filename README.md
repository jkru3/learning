these notes are purely for my own learning of technical subjects. They are organized to fit my needs and no one else's

- each subject is it's own directory, either in 'active' or 'backburner'
- i put everything i learn as a stream of notes into `TIL.md`
    - i start each session with a `# yyyy/mm/dd`
    - i end each session with a `---` so i know when to date the next note-taking session
- if i'm reviewing my notes, i'll make a `revised.md` document
- if it's links to videos or readings, i'll make a `resources.md` document
- if i'm trying to apply my knowledge, i'll make a `projects/` directory
    - each project will get it's own directory
- if i'm drawing out notes, i'll make a `drawings/` directory
    - i use Excelcidraw
    - drawings will be referred linked by respective `TIL.md`
